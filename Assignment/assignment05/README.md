# **The correlation of diabetes and obesity in the US in 2017.**

In this project, I gather two datasets which are talking about "diagnosed diabetes among adults aged >=18 years" and "Obesity among adults aged >=18 years" in the US in 2017 from the CDC.

By merging these two dataset, I create different plots such as leaflets, boxplots, and scatter plots to show the correlation.
